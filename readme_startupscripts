This guide will tell you everything you need to know to get a rover brain auto-pulling from Git and running its software on startup!

First, you'll need Wi-Fi working. Consult readme_wifi.txt for a walkthrough.

Getting things to run on startup in Linux is straightforward. Just add the desired commands to the .bashrc file, which should exist in the home directory (~). The .bashrc file is hidden, but it's there (ls -a will flush it out).

You'll want to install Git. sudo apt-get install git

Make new folders in ~ to pull the files into. Then follow these instructions for setting up the repo: https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/

Then in your .bashrc you can add the commands "git -C ~/[path] pull" for every GitHub repo you are using. At the time of this writing, that means the Shell and RaspberryPiSetup repos.

For the joystick to work, you'll need to install pygame. Follow the top answer at https://askubuntu.com/questions/401342/how-to-download-pygame-in-python3-3

You'll also need to install pyserial:
apt install python3-pip
pip3 install pyserial --user

And then you shoujld be good to go:
python3 shell_start.py

Note: pip is for python 2, pip3 is for python 3. Similarly, you MUST call Python scripts using the python3 command rather than simply calling their names. Calling their names may attempt to run them in Python 2, which won't work.
